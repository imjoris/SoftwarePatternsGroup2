\chapter{Architecture evaluation}
\label{ch:evaluation}

In this chapter the architecture of the system will be evaluated. After taking architectural decisions and building the system the architects have to make sure that the patterns applied suit the architecture, especially the quality attributes and key drivers.%in terms of benefits and liablities.

\section{Key-Driver Validation}

\subsection*{Layers}
\subsection*{Service Layer}
The Service Layer pattern defines the boundary of the application using a layer of services to be used by clients. This increases the interoperability, since the set of operation offered by the service layer are available to many kinds of clients. \\
\textbf{Benefits \& Liabilities} ~
\begin{itemize}
\item[+] Interoperability 
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Front-Controller}
\subsection*{Domain Model}
\subsection*{Model View Controller}
Model View Controller decouples the view, the logic, and the data modeling of the interface. Thus it is easier to modify the view without interfering the logic and data model. This results in good modifiability and better update to the usability since updating the view is relatively easy to increase the usability.

\textbf{Benefits \& Liabilities} ~
\begin{itemize} 
\item[+] Usability
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Template view}
Template view separates each components of a web page to individual snippets. The snippets are combined together to form a web page using a HTML helper. Since the elements are separated, code reusability is increased. Updates are also easy to be implemented, since updating one snippet may results in updated elements in several pages at once. Thus, template view increases the usability of the system because of its ease of web page update.

\textbf{Benefits \& Liabilities} ~
\begin{itemize} 
\item[+] Usability
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Unit of Work}
The Unit of Work will significantly reduce the load on the database. The increased performance has a direct impact on the usability of the system. Faster processing will make the web interface of the system more responsive to the actions of the user, which increases the usability.

While the unit of work does introduce a delay before the change in the in-memory object is present in the representation in the database, this delay is very short and does not affect the functional correctness of the system or the reliability of its results.\\
\textbf{Benefits \& Liabilities} ~
\begin{itemize}
\item[+] Performance 
\item[+] Usability
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Shared Repository} 
%Repositories are the single point where we hand off and fetch objects. It is also the boundary where communication with the storage starts and ends.
%Mediates between the domain and the data mapping layers using a collection-like interface for accessing domain objects.

\textit{Benefits} \\

The repository gives a lot more control over how the data is handled. The benefits are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Reduces code (and code complexity)
\item Increases performance
\item Separated domain and data layers, increasing flexibility and changeability
\end{itemize}

Performing analysis on the data also consists of executing complex queries on the data source. The database that executes these queries, however, might change. Or the system might decide to use multiple databases and data sources.
Using the Repository pattern, these changes can be made fast. The repository also allows for multiple configurations to exist. So an extra repository could be created for testing purposes, only using an in-memory database to increase the test execution speed. \\

\textit{} Liabilities \\
\textbf{+ Reusability} \\
\textbf{+ Integrability} \\
\textbf{+ Modifiability Changeability} by the Separation of concerns\\
