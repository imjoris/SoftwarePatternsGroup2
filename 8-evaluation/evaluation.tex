\chapter{Architecture evaluation}
\label{ch:evaluation}

In this chapter the architecture of the system will be evaluated. After taking architectural decisions and building the system the architects have to make sure that the patterns applied suit the architecture, especially the quality attributes and key drivers.%in terms of benefits and liablities.

\section{Key-Driver Validation}

\subsection*{Layers}
The layers improve the maintainability of the system, they support reusability.
The performance is reduced, since the propagation of request/calls through the layers can be inefficient.\\
\textbf{Benefits \& Liabilities} ~
\begin{itemize}
\item[+] Maintainability
\item[-] Performance 
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Service Layer}
The Service Layer pattern defines the boundary of the application using a layer of services to be used by clients. This increases the interoperability, since the set of operation offered by the service layer are available to many kinds of clients. \\
\textbf{Benefits \& Liabilities} ~
\begin{itemize}
\item[+] Interoperability 
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Front-Controller}
By having a central point that handles all requests, all the requests get prepossessed for the domain layer in the same way. All the common functions like security and logging are handled by the front controller for each request.\\
It increases security because the security the request security is handled before any other operation in the system. And the security is handled the same for every request.\\
Reliability increases, because all the the common functions are centrally handled and so there are no duplicate implementations leading to unexpected results. \\
The front page increases maintainability because the way each request is received and initially handled can be modified in a central place in a very flexible way. It allows for easy modifications of the piping functions by using the decorator pattern.\\
A downside of the front page controller is that it is a single point of failure. If the front page controller is faulty or doesn't work, then the entire system fails. And if a function in the front page takes a long time to execute, then the performance of the entire system decreases. However, the front page controller makes testing the system easier since the functions are handled in one place.\\

In conclusion, the front page has the following benefits and liabilities:\\
\textbf{Benefits \& Liabilities} ~
\begin{itemize}
\item[+] Reliability
\item[+] Modifiability
\item[+] Security
\item[$-$] Performance
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Domain Model}
\subsection*{Broker}
The reliability of the system increases by the use of the Broker pattern. The pattern guarantees the delivery of messages to the destination. This guarantees that statistics are computed by a server in the compute cluster.
The modifiability of the system increases, since the brokers separate the messaging logic from the domain logic. This means that changes to the messaging logic do not affect the rest of the system.

The interoperability of the system increases as well, since the broker allow the system to interoperate with the servers in the compute cluster.

The broker pattern does however introduce a slight overhead, which reduces the performance.\\
\textbf{Benefits \& Liabilities} ~
\begin{itemize}
\item[+] Reliability
\item[+] Modifiability
\item[+] Interoperability
\item[$-$] Performance
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Model View Controller}
Model View Controller decouples the view, the logic, and the data modeling of the interface. Thus it is easier to modify the view without interfering the logic and data model. This results in good modifiability and better update to the usability since updating the view is relatively easy to increase the usability.

\textbf{Benefits \& Liabilities} ~
\begin{itemize} 
\item[+] Usability
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Template view}
Template view separates each components of a web page to individual snippets. The snippets are combined together to form a web page using a HTML helper. Since the elements are separated, code reusability is increased. Updates are also easy to be implemented, since updating one snippet may results in updated elements in several pages at once. Thus, template view increases the usability of the system because of its ease of web page update.

\textbf{Benefits \& Liabilities} ~
\begin{itemize} 
\item[+] Usability
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Unit of Work}
The Unit of Work will significantly reduce the load on the database. The increased performance has a direct impact on the usability of the system. Faster processing will make the web interface of the system more responsive to the actions of the user, which increases the usability.

While the unit of work does introduce a delay before the change in the in-memory object is present in the representation in the database, this delay is very short and does not affect the functional correctness of the system or the reliability of its results.\\
\textbf{Benefits \& Liabilities} ~
\begin{itemize}
\item[+] Performance 
\item[+] Usability
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Shared Repository} 
%Repositories are the single point where we hand off and fetch objects. It is also the boundary where communication with the storage starts and ends.
%Mediates between the domain and the data mapping layers using a collection-like interface for accessing domain objects.
The repository gives a lot more control over how the data is handled. The benefits are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Reduces code (and code complexity)
\item Increases performance
\item Separated domain and data layers, increasing flexibility and changeability
\end{itemize}

Performing analysis on the data also consists of executing complex queries on the data source. The database that executes these queries, however, might change. The system could also decide to use multiple databases and data sources.
Using the Repository pattern, processing these changes is simplified and can be made in a flexible way that does not effect the rest of the system. The repository also allows for multiple configurations to exist. So an extra repository could be created for testing purposes, only using an in-memory database to increase the test execution speed. \\
\textbf{Benefits \& Liabilities} ~
\begin{itemize}
\item[+] Reusability : because the data store is central
\item[+] Integrability : because the data store is central
\item[+] Maintainability : thanks to the Separation of concerns
\item[+] Modifiability : thanks to the Separation of concerns
\end{itemize}
