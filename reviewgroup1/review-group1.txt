General remarks:
- Sentences are often too long. This leads to unclear and ambiguous descriptions.
- Quite allot of "We " and "our". Try to reduce using those words to a minimum.

Significant notes:
- I think the broker pattern is confused with the proxy pattern. This is not the way the broker pattern is used.
- The repository and the broker pattern don't differ allot accourding to the document. The only difference is that the repository explicitly accesses data storage.
- There is not need for a verification cluster
-
