\section{Elaborated Model}
\label{sec:elaboratedmodel}

In Figure~\ref{fig:elaboratedmodel} the elaborated system model is shown. This figure gives a high-level overview of the software and hardware of the system. In this figure, the arrows represent the data flow.

Each house sends collected electricity usage data to the systems `Data receival API', which stores the collected data in a storage cluster.
An end-user of the system can visit the web interface using a web browser on any device. Using this web interface, the user can generate statistics data, which is done by a separate software component of the system.

%TODO: update diagram for configuration/registering new devices etc.
