\label{ch:evolution}
Due to new environmental issues(global warming, etc) The Home Energy Monitoring is a market in expansion and building green-friendly systems has become an important issue nowadays. This is an opportunity for the HEMS to grow by adding new features in the years to come. \\
" Various studies have shown a reduction in home energy use of 4-15\%\ through use of home energy display " (Source : \textit{Wikipedia} ). This percentage show the efficiency and the impact on the everyday life of such systems and that more and more users will use them. 

 \paragraph{Monitoring other energy consumption}
 The system will access new API and data stores providing other external energy data like gas consumption for example. 

 \paragraph{Computing new analysis}
The system will allow the user to compute and display to the user his greenhouse gas emission for example.

 %\paragraph{Application}
 %in order to make the access to his interface easier for the user an application for Android, Windows Phone and iOS will be built.
  
 \paragraph{Home automation functionnalities}
Knowing how the user consumes is good but controlling it is even better. \\ One of the goal of HEMS is to make the user more energy efficient.
The website/application will allow the user to control devices remotely (turning them on/off or changing light luminosity or heating intensity for example). \\
Th system will be able to advice the user about his energy consumption (ex: you should turn off this light because the room is empty, etc).
