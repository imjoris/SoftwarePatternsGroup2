\section{Stories and use-cases}

In this section the architectural significant use-cases will be presented.

% Installation ?
% Collect and store energy consumption
% The End-Uer wants to display his bill ( to specific ? ) / his energy conumption
% Update ?
% Computation ? by Spark , Map/Reduce , DOES THE SYSTEM COMPUTE THE STATISTICS ONLY WHEN THE USER ASKS FOR PECIFIC STATITICS OR EVERYTIME ?
