\section{Risk assessment}
\label{sec:risk-assesment}

The system is confronted by several risks which are determined and mitigated in this section.
Taking those risks into account allows to avoid them or at least reduce their impact. 
The risk management involves the identification of the risks, their probability and potential impact or consequences.

The tables below explain the meaning of the definition for probability and consequence.

	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
		\hline \textbf{Probability} & \textbf{Likelihood of occurrence} \\ 
		\hline High                 & 0.65 - 1.00                       \\ 
		\hline Medium               & 0.35 - 0.65                       \\

		\hline Significant       & A risk that can lead to damages, can delay the project more than 3 months or causes one of the high-level requirements not to be fulfilled. \\ 
		\hline Moderate          & A risk that can lead to one of the high-level requirements not to be fulfilled to an acceptable level.                                      \\ 
		\hline Minor             & A risk that can lead to one of the high-level requirements not being fully fulfilled, but still fulfilled in an acceptable level.           \\

\subsection{Business}
\risk{B}
{Wrong estimation of the budget}
{Medium}
{Significant. The final product does not have the features expected.}
{The team needs an accountant or at least someone taking care of the follow-up of the money. Make sure there are regular evaluations to keep track of the money flow.}
{Remove some requirements or features of the product, or change the hardware components used.}
{risk:budget}

\risk{B}
{Wrong estimation of the budget: the money invested in the fabrication and achievement of the product/system is not covered by the sales (shortfall/deficit)}
{Medium}
{Moderate. Stopping the sale}
{The team needs an accountant or at least someone taking care of the follow-up of the money.}
{Adding more features to the product in order to make it more competitive in the market.}

\subsection{Schedule}


\risk{S}
{The project is not finished at the deadline}
{Low}
{Significant. Pressure for all the team members, loss of credibility regarding the customers, selling a product with less features than expected.}
{ SRA , Schedule Risk analysis : Estimation of the duration of the project by its manager ( with the use of probability and statistics ) . Meeting for the team members every week to keep track of the timing and take decisions according to the deadline. }
{ Postpone the deadline or remove some features when the deadline can't be postponed. }
