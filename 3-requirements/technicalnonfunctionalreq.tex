\section{Technical non-functional requirements}

\subsection{Usability}
The sytem will be hopefully use by a lot of people who don't necessarly have knowledge in the technology field so the Usability is an important requirement so the end-user can acces all the information he needs. \\

 	\pgfplotstabletypeset[%
 		UCTable
 	]{%
 		value & description \\
 		\req{US} & An application is available for tablets and phone with those OS Windows Phone,Android, and Iphone. \\
 		\req{US} & The end-user needs maximum ten minutes to get a basic understanding of system features through the UI. \\
 		\req{US} & The UI has a FAQ and a help section. \\
 		\req{US} & Every feature/major option of the system can be accessed through the home page(Single Page Application). \\
 	}

% Email The user can receive an email with the information he aked (for example etimate bill) once a month.
%Error message

\subsection{Reliability}
 	\pgfplotstabletypeset[%
 		UCTable
 	]{%
 		value & description \\
 		\req{RE} & A margin of error of $5\%$ in the energy measurements is tolerated. \\
 	}
 	
\subsection{Security}
Ensuring the security for the system is a major issue so all the data needed for its good functioning remain protected and consistent. \\

 	\pgfplotstabletypeset[%
 		UCTable
 	]{%
 		value & description \\
 		\req{SEC} & Each user is identified and has to log in in order to view his "Home Energy Monitor" account. \\
 		\req{SEC} & The data in the database is encrypted. \\ % developp , which database ?
 		\req{SEC} & Passwords of the users are stored and transmitted as a hash\\
 	}


\subsection{Availability}
 	\pgfplotstabletypeset[%
 		UCTable
 	]{%
 		value & description \\
 		\req{AVA} & The sytem should be available $99.9\%$. of the time. \\
 		\req{AVA} & The system should be down for maximum ten minutes when the user installs a new release(version). \\
 	}
%$AV = \frac{\text{MTTF}}{\text{MTTF} + \text{MTTR}} = \frac{\text{6 months}}{\text{6 months }+\text{ 12 hours}} = \frac{4380 \text{ hours}}{4380 + 12 \text{ hours}} = 99.7 \%$
% computation 

\subsection{Scalability} 
The system should make the increase of workload, resources and users easy that's why the scalability is an important Key driver.\\
 	\pgfplotstabletypeset[%
 		UCTable
 	]{%
 		value & description \\
 		\req{SCA} & The system must be able to monitor several kind of energy consumption for example: gas ,solar, temperature. \\
 	\req{SCA} & The system should function as efficiently even if the number of users increase \\% increase in the number of users \\
