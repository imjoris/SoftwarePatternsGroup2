\section{Technical non-functional requirements}

\subsection{Usability}
The sytem will be hopefully use by a lot of people who don't necessarly have knowledge in the technology field so the Usability is an important requirement so the end-user can acces all the information he needs. \\

US-1 An application is available for tablets and phone with those OS Windows Phone,Android, and Iphone. \\ % is it fonctionnal or non fonctionnal ?
US-2  The end-user needs maximum ten minutes to get a basic understanding of system features through the UI. \\
US-3  The UI has a FAQ and a help section. \\
US-4  Every feature/major option of the system can be accessed through the home page(Single Page Application). \\

% Email The user can receive an email with the information he aked (for example etimate bill) once a month.
%Error message


\subsection{Reliability}
RE-1 A margin of error of $5\%$.5percent in the energy measurements is tolerated. \\
 % from where do we get the energy data ?
 
\subsection{Security}
Ensuring the security for the system is a major issue so all the data needed for its good functioning remain protected and consistent. \\

S-1 Each user is identified and get acess to his "Home Energy Monitor" account with a login. \\
S-2 The data of the database is encrypted. \\ % developp , which database ?
% password hidden


\subsection{Availability}

AVA-1 The sytem should be available $99.9\%$. of the time. \\

%$AV = \frac{\text{MTTF}}{\text{MTTF} + \text{MTTR}} = \frac{\text{6 months}}{\text{6 months }+\text{ 12 hours}} = \frac{4380 \text{ hours}}{4380 + 12 \text{ hours}} = 99.7 \%$
% computation 


AVA-2 The system should be down for maximum ten minutes when the user install a new release(version). \\

\subsection{Scalability} 

The system should make the increase of workload, resources and users easy that's why the scalability is an important Key driver.\\
% support for "other kind" of energy
SCA-1 The sytem must be able to monitor everal kind of energy consumption for example: gas ,solar, temperature. \\ % increase in the number of resources
SCA-2 The system should function as efficienly even if the number of users increase \\% increase in the number of users
