\section{Technical non-functional requirements}
In this section, the technical non-functional aspects that are important to the system are described.

\subsection{Usability}
The sytem will be hopefully used by a lot of people who don't necessarily have knowledge in the technology field so the Usability is an important requirement so the end-user can acces all the information he needs. \\

 	\pgfplotstabletypeset[%
 		UCTable
 	]{%
 		value & description \\
 		\req{US} & An application is available for tablets and phone with those OS Windows Phone,Android, and Iphone. \\
 		\req{US} & The end-user needs maximum ten minutes to get a basic understanding of system features through the UI. \\
 		\req{US} & Every feature/major option of the system can be accessed through the home page(Single Page Application). \\
 	}

% Email The user can receive an email with the information he aked (for example etimate bill) once a month.
%Error message

\subsection{Reliability}

 		UCTable
 	]{%
 		value & description \\
 		\req{RE} & A margin of error of $5\%$ in the energy measurements is tolerated. \\ % incaccurary ?
 		\req{RE} & The system should be available $99.9\%$. of the time which means down for 44 minutes within 6 months. 
 		$AV = \frac{\text{MTTF}}{\text{MTTF} + \text{MTTR}} = \frac{\text{6 months}}{\text{6 months }+\text{44 minutes}} = \frac{4380 \text{ hours}}{4380 + 12 \text{ hours}} = 99.9 \%$ \\
 		\req{RE} & The system should be down for maximum ten minutes when the user installs a new release(version). \\
 	}

 	
\subsection{Security}
Ensuring the security for the system is a major issue so all the data needed for its good functioning remain protected and consistent. \\

 	\pgfplotstabletypeset[%
 		UCTable
 	]{%
 		value & description \\
 		\req{SEC} & Each user is identified and has to log in in order to access his "Home Energy Monitor" account. \\
 		\req{SEC} & The data stored in the database is encrypted. \\ % developp , which database ?
 		\req{SEC} & The connection from/to the system is encrypted using secure connection. \\
 	}

\subsection{Interoperability}
\pgfplotstabletypeset[%
 		UCTable
 	]{%
 		value & description \\
 		\req{INT} & The web interface of the system is available and functioning for 95\% of the browser market share. \\
 		\req{INT} & The system exposes a REST interface that allows different electricity usage sensors to submit the electricity usage data. \\ 
 	}
 

\subsection{Scalability} 

The system should make the increase in workload, resources and users easy to handle that's why the scalability its part of non functional requirements of the system.\\

 	\pgfplotstabletypeset[%
 		UCTable
 	]{%
 		value & description \\
 		%\req{SCA} & The system must be able to monitor several kind of energy consumption for example: gas ,solar, temperature. \\
 	\req{SCA} & The system should still perform as efficiently as it is suppose to be when the number of users doubled. \\% increase in the number of users \\
 	\req{SCA} & The system should still perform as efficiently as it is suppose to be when the number of devices doubled. \\ % percentage ?
